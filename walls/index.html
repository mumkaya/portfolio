                    This 400-mile combination of walls and fences divides Israel from 
                    the West Bank Palestinian territory. Israel’s government began to construct 
                    this barrier at the height of the second intifada, in 2002. Eleven years later, 
                    the barrier is almost complete, and it has become one of the most controversial 
                    border security projects in the world. Israel calls the barrier a “security fence,” 
                    claiming it has helped to reduce attacks by Palestinian terrorists on Israeli towns 
                    and settlements. Palestinian activists call the barrier an “apartheid wall.” They 
                    say the wall has served as an excuse for stealing Palestinian land and made life 
                    difficult for Palestinians who work over the border -- 
                    including thousands who were separated from their farmlands.

                   This 1,500-mile wall was built in the 1980s by the Moroccan army to ward off attacks from 
                   the Polisario Front, a guerrilla group seeking independence for the Western Sahara region. 
                   As the conflict evolved and the Moroccan army pushed deeper into the guerrillas' stronghold, 
                   troops took down the sand wall and moved it several times. The great wall of sand still exists. 
                   It now starts at Morocco's southern border with Mauritania, stands nine feet high and is s
                   upplemented with anti-personnel radars, infantry units, mines and artillery.

                    In Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland, there are 40 barriers separating Catholic and 
                    Protestant communities. This network of barriers is about 13 miles long and is known as 
                    the Peace Walls. The barriers were initially built in 1969, following a spate of sectarian r
                    iots that led to years of conflict between the religious factions. Some local residents, w
                    ho still fear violence from neighbors with opposing views and different religions, want the barriers to stay.

                    During the 1950's, some 3.5 million dissatisfied residents of East Germany defected from the communist 
                    country by crossing into the capitalist stronghold of West Berlin. The East German government reacted to t
                    his embarrassing problem by building the Berlin Wall, with construction starting in 1961. At its most developed 
                    state in the late '70s, the Berlin Wall was up to 12 feet high. There were 116 watchtowers along the wall, which was 
                    also surrounded by a 100-yard-wide death strip -- a flat area with no buildings, where anyone approaching the wall 
                    could be easily shot by border guards. Despite such dangers, an estimated 5,000 people attempted to illegally 
                    cross the wall during its 28-year lifespan. Historians estimate that at least 600 people died in the attempt.

                    It's not exactly a wall but more like a heavily patrolled border zone lined with guard towers, 
                    barbed wire and numerous fields carpeted in landmines. The demilitarized zone is 160 miles long 
                    and 2.5 miles wide. It was established after the 1953 Korean War Armistice, to prevent North Korean 
                    and South Korean forces from getting too close to each other. The DMZ's crazy features include a 
                    conference building right on the borderline, where one half of the main room is in North Korea, 
                    and another half in South Korea. There's also a propaganda village on the North Korean side of 
                    the DMZ made up of shiny but empty buildings, which were built to make South Koreans think that life 
                    was good in the north. Since it was established, South Korean forces have discovered four different 
                    tunnels built to allegedly help North Korean agents bypass the DMZ for mischievous missions.

                    The term Great Wall of China refers to a series of fortifications built by several Chinese dynasties, 
                    from the 8th century BC to the 15th century AD. The walls, which measure at least 5,000 miles, helped 
                    to ward off invasions from northern peoples like the Mongols and the Manchus. The Mongols made their way 
                    around the wall in the 13th century and conquered Beijing, establishing the Yuan Dynasty. 
                    In 1644 the Manchus crossed the wall and established their own dynasty as well.
