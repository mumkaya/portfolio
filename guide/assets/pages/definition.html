	<div class="landing-body">A stereotype is an exaggerated belief, image or distorted truth about a person or group -a generalization that allows for little or no individual differences or social variation. Stereotypes are based on images in mass media, or reputations passed on by parents, peers and other members of society. Stereotypes can be positive or negative.

<p>A prejudice is an opinion, prejudgment or attitude about a group or its individual members. A prejudice can be positive, but in here it refers to a negative attitude.</p>

<p>Prejudices are often accompanied by ignorance, fear or hatred. Prejudices are formed by a complex psychological process that begins with attachment to a close circle of acquaintances or an "in-group" such as a family. Prejudice is often aimed at "out-groups."</p>

</p>Discrimination is behavior that treats people unequally because of their group memberships. Discriminatory behavior, ranging from slights to hate crimes, often begins with negative stereotypes and prejudices.</p>
